Some servers should be accessible through the Internet, and other servers should only be accessible over the internal network. All servers need to be able to talk to each other over specific ports and protocols.

Create a single VPC with a subnet for the DMZ and a subnet for the LAN. 2. Set up firewall rules to open up relevant traffic between the DMZ and the LAN subnets, and another firewall rule to allow public ingress traffic for the DMZ.</li><li>B. 1. Create a single VPC with a subnet for the DMZ and a subnet for the LAN. 2. Set up firewall rules to open up relevant traffic between the DMZ and the LAN subnets, and another firewall rule to allow public egress traffic for the DMZ.</li><li>C. 1. Create a VPC with a subnet for the DMZ and another VPC with a subnet for the LAN. 2.
