TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: about 80\% of their business is from mining and 20\% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.</p><p>Company background -<br>
TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.<br>
TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers&#x27; needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.</p><p>Solution Concept -<br>
There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.<br>
Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.</p><p>Existing Technical Environment -<br>
<img src="/blog/assets/images/0002400001-e8839ef2fb1cef081b7a169793dc7515.png"><br>
TerramEarth&#x27;s existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via<br>
FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.<br>
With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60\%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.</p><p>Business Requirements -<br>
Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus inventory<br>
Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services<br>
Have the ability to partner with different companies - especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business - to create compelling joint offerings for their customers.</p><p>CEO Statement -<br>
We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly, and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers&#x27; yields by 25\%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50\% of our revenues by 2020.</p><p>CTO Statement -<br>
Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I&#x27;m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn&#x27;t take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations. Question TerramEarth&#x27;s CTO wants to use the raw data from connected vehicles to help identify approximately when a vehicle in the field will have a catastrophic failure.<br>
You want to allow analysts to centrally query the vehicle data.<br>

TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.<br>
TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers&#x27; needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.</p><p>Solution Concept -<br>
There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.<br>
Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.</p><p>Existing Technical Environment -<br>

Question You analyzed TerramEarth&#x27;s business requirement to reduce downtime, and found that they can achieve a majority of time saving by reducing customer&#x27;s wait time for parts. You decided to focus on reduction of the 3 weeks aggregate reporting time.<br>
Which modifications to the company&#x27;s processes should you recommend\?</p><ul><li>A. Migrate from CSV to binary format, migrate from FTP to SFTP transport, and develop machine learning analysis of metrics</li><li>B. Migrate from FTP to streaming transport, migrate from CSV to binary format, and develop machine learning analysis of metrics</li><li>C. Increase fleet cellular connectivity to 80\%, migrate from FTP to streaming transport, and develop machine learning analysis of metrics</li><li>D. Migrate from FTP to SFTP transport, develop machine learning analysis of metrics, and increase dealer local inventory by a fixed factor</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C<br>
The Avro binary format is the preferred format for loading compressed data. Avro data is faster to load because the data can be read in parallel, even when the data blocks are compressed.<br>
Cloud Storage supports streaming transfers with the gsutil tool or boto library, based on HTTP chunked transfer encoding. Streaming data lets you stream data to and from your Cloud Storage account as soon as it becomes available without requiring that the data be first saved to a separate file. Streaming transfers are useful if you have a process that generates data and you do not want to buffer it locally before uploading it, or if you want to send the result from a computational pipeline directly into Cloud Storage.<br>

Have the vehicle&#x27;s computer compress the data in hourly snapshots, and store it in a GCS Coldline bucket</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D<br>
Storage is the best choice for data that you plan to access at most once a year, due to its slightly lower availability, 90-day minimum storage duration, costs for data access, and higher per-operation costs. For example:<br>
Cold Data Storage - Infrequently accessed data, such as data stored for legal or regulatory reasons, can be stored at low cost as Coldline Storage, and be available when you need it.<br>
Disaster recovery - In the event of a disaster recovery event, recovery time is key. Cloud Storage provides low latency access to data stored as Coldline Storage.<br>

TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and agricultural industries: about 80\% of their business is from mining and 20\% from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.</p><p>Company background -<br>
TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II. The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be extended members of their family.<br>
TerramEarth is proud of their ability to innovate on their core products and find new markets as their customers&#x27; needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with a human operator.</p><p>Solution Concept -<br>
There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.<br>
Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.</p><p>Existing Technical Environment -<br>
<img src="/blog/assets/images/0002400001-e8839ef2fb1cef081b7a169793dc7515.png"><br>
TerramEarth&#x27;s existing architecture is composed of Linux-based systems that reside in a data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via<br>
FTP, transform and aggregate them, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.<br>
With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60\%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.</p><p>Business Requirements -<br>
Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus inventory<br>
Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services<br>
Have the ability to partner with different companies - especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business - to create compelling joint offerings for their customers.</p><p>CEO Statement -<br>
We have been successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly, and TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With this technology, we have been able to increase farmers&#x27; yields by 25\%, by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will generate 50\% of our revenues by 2020.</p><p>CTO Statement -<br>
Our competitive advantage has always been in the manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I&#x27;m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn&#x27;t take technology obsolescence seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations. Question Operational parameters such as oil pressure are adjustable on each of TerramEarth&#x27;s vehicles to increase their efficiency, depending on their environmental conditions. Your primary goal is to increase the operating efficiency of all 20 million cellular and unconnected vehicles in the field.<br>
How can you accomplish this goal\?</p><ul><li>A. Have you engineers inspect the data for patterns, and then create an algorithm with rules that make operational adjustments automatically</li><li>B. Capture all operating data, train machine learning models that identify ideal operations, and run locally to make operational adjustments automatically</li><li>C. Implement a Google Cloud Dataflow streaming job with a sliding window, and use Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) to make operational adjustments automatically</li><li>D.

They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in 100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers more productive.</p><p>Solution Concept -<br>
There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with new computing modules.<br>
Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of 120 fields of data per second, with<br>
22 hours of operation per day, TerramEarth collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles.</p><p>Existing Technical Environment -<br>
TerramEarth&#x27;s existing architecture is composed of Linux and Windows-based systems that reside in a single U.S, west coast based data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via FTP, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old.<br>
With this data, TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60\%. However, because the data is stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they wait for replacement parts.</p><p>Business Requirements -<br>
Decrease unplanned vehicle downtime to less than 1 week<br>
Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use their equipment to better position new products and services<br>
Have the ability to partner with different companies - especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business - to create compelling joint offerings for their customers</p><p>Technical Requirements -<br>
Expand beyond a single datacenter to decrease latency to the American midwest and east coast<br>
Create a backup strategy<br>
Increase security of data transfer from equipment to the datacenter<br>
Improve data in the data warehouse<br>
Use customer and equipment data to anticipate customer needs</p><p>Application 1: Data ingest -<br>

Our competitive advantage has always been in our manufacturing process, with our ability to build better vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different approaches are constantly being developed, and I&#x27;m concerned that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through incremental innovations. Question For this question, refer to the TerramEarth case study. You are asked to design a new architecture for the ingestion of the data of the 200,000 vehicles that are connected to a cellular network. You want to follow Google-recommended practices.<br>

Question At Dress4Win, an operations engineer wants to create a tow-cost solution to remotely archive copies of database backup files.<br>
The database files are compressed tar files stored in their current data center.<br>
How should he proceed\?</p><ul><li>A. Create a cron script using gsutil to copy the files to a Coldline Storage bucket.</li><li>B. Create a cron script using gsutil to copy the files to a Regional Storage bucket.</li><li>C. Create a Cloud Storage Transfer Service Job to copy the files to a Coldline Storage bucket.</li><li>D. Create a Cloud Storage Transfer Service job to copy the files to a Regional Storage bucket.</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A<br>
Follow these rules of thumb when deciding whether to use gsutil or Storage Transfer Service:<br>
* When transferring data from an on-premises location, use gsutil.<br>
* When transferring data from another cloud storage provider, use Storage Transfer Service.<br>
* Otherwise, evaluate both tools with respect to your specific scenario.<br>

Helicopter Racing League (HRL) is a global sports league for competitive helicopter racing. Each year HRL holds the world championship and several regional league competitions where teams compete to earn a spot in the world championship. HRL offers a paid service to stream the races all over the world with live telemetry and predictions throughout each race.</p><p>Solution concept -<br>
HRL wants to migrate their existing service to a new platform to expand their use of managed AI and ML services to facilitate race predictions. Additionally, as new fans engage with the sport, particularly in emerging regions, they want to move the serving of their content, both real-time and recorded, closer to their users.</p><p>Existing technical environment -<br>
HRL is a public cloud-first company; the core of their mission-critical applications runs on their current public cloud provider. Video recording and editing is performed at the race tracks, and the content is encoded and transcoded, where needed, in the cloud. Enterprise-grade connectivity and local compute is provided by truck-mounted mobile data centers. Their race prediction services are hosted exclusively on their existing public cloud provider. Their existing technical environment is as follows:<br>
Existing content is stored in an object storage service on their existing public cloud provider.<br>
Video encoding and transcoding is performed on VMs created for each job.<br>
Race predictions are performed using TensorFlow running on VMs in the current public cloud provider.</p><p>Business requirements -<br>
HRL&#x27;s owners want to expand their predictive capabilities and reduce latency for their viewers in emerging markets. Their requirements are:<br>
Support ability to expose the predictive models to partners.<br>
Increase predictive capabilities during and before races:  </p><ul><li>Race results  </li><li>Mechanical failures  </li><li>Crowd sentiment<br>Increase telemetry and create additional insights.<br>Measure fan engagement with new predictions.<br>Enhance global availability and quality of the broadcasts.<br>Increase the number of concurrent viewers.<br>Minimize operational complexity.<br>Ensure compliance with regulations.<br>Create a merchandising revenue stream.</li></ul><p>Technical requirements -<br>
Maintain or increase prediction throughput and accuracy.<br>
Reduce viewer latency.<br>
Increase transcoding performance.<br>
Create real-time analytics of viewer consumption patterns and engagement.<br>
Create a data mart to enable processing of large volumes of race data.</p><p>Executive statement -<br>
Our CEO, S. Hawke, wants to bring high-adrenaline racing to fans all around the world. We listen to our fans, and they want enhanced video streams that include predictions of events within the race (e.g., overtaking). Our current platform allows us to predict race outcomes but lacks the facility to support real-time predictions during races and the capacity to process season-long results.
