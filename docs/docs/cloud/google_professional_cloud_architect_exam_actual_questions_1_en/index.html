The full test suite takes several hours to complete, running on a limited number of on-premises servers reserved for testing. Your company wants to move the testing infrastructure to the cloud, to reduce the amount of time it takes to fully test a change to the system, while changing the tests as little as possible.<br>
Which cloud infrastructure should you recommend\?</p><ul><li>A. Google Compute Engine unmanaged instance groups and Network Load Balancer</li><li>B. Google Compute Engine managed instance groups with auto-scaling</li><li>C. Google Cloud Dataproc to run Apache Hadoop jobs to process each test</li><li>D. Google App Engine with Google StackDriver for logging</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B<br>
Google Compute Engine enables users to launch virtual machines (VMs) on demand. VMs can be launched from the standard images or custom images created by users.<br>
Managed instance groups offer autoscaling capabilities that allow you to automatically add or remove instances from a managed instance group based on increases or decreases in load. Autoscaling helps your applications gracefully handle increases in traffic and reduces cost when the need for resources is lower.<br>
Incorrect Answers:<br>
B: There is no mention of incoming IP data traffic for the custom C++ applications.<br>
C: Apache Hadoop is not fit for testing C++ applications. Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for distributed storage and processing of datasets of big data using the MapReduce programming model.<br>
D: Google App Engine is intended to be used for web applications.<br>
Google App Engine (often referred to as GAE or simply App Engine) is a web framework and cloud computing platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers.<br>

You want to help him ensure his application will run properly on Google Cloud Platform.<br>
What should you do\?</p><ul><li>A. Help the engineer to convert his websocket code to use HTTP streaming</li><li>B. Review the encryption requirements for websocket connections with the security team</li><li>C. Meet with the cloud operations team and the engineer to discuss load balancer options</li><li>D. Help the engineer redesign the application to use a distributed user session service that does not rely on websockets and HTTP sessions.</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C<br>
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) HTTP(S) load balancing provides global load balancing for HTTP(S) requests destined for your instances.<br>
The HTTP(S) load balancer has native support for the WebSocket protocol.<br>
Incorrect Answers:<br>
A: HTTP server push, also known as HTTP streaming, is a client-server communication pattern that sends information from an HTTP server to a client asynchronously, without a client request. A server push architecture is especially effective for highly interactive web or mobile applications, where one or more clients need to receive continuous information from the server.<br>

You have another 9 months to design and deploy a more cloud-native solution. Specifically, you want a system that is no-ops and auto-scaling.<br>
Which two compute products should you choose\? (Choose two.)</p><ul><li>A. Compute Engine with containers</li><li>B. Google Kubernetes Engine with containers</li><li>C. Google App Engine Standard Environment</li><li>D. Compute Engine with custom instance types</li><li>E. Compute Engine with managed instance groups</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> BC<br>
B: With Container Engine, Google will automatically deploy your cluster for you, update, patch, secure the nodes.<br>
Kubernetes Engine&#x27;s cluster autoscaler automatically resizes clusters based on the demands of the workloads you want to run.<br>
C: Solutions like Datastore, BigQuery, AppEngine, etc are truly NoOps.<br>
App Engine by default scales the number of instances running up and down to match the load, thus providing consistent performance for your app at all times while minimizing idle instances and thus reducing cost.<br>
Note: At a high level, NoOps means that there is no infrastructure to build out and manage during usage of the platform. Typically, the compromise you make with<br>
NoOps is that you lose control of the underlying infrastructure.<br>

After configuring the instance group as a backend service to an HTTP(S) load balancer, you notice that virtual machine (VM) instances are being terminated and re-launched every minute. The instances do not have a public IP address.<br>

What should you do\?</p><ul><li>A. Ensure that a firewall rules exists to allow source traffic on HTTP/HTTPS to reach the load balancer.</li><li>B. Assign a public IP to each instance and configure a firewall rule to allow the load balancer to reach the instance public IP.</li><li>C. Ensure that a firewall rule exists to allow load balancer health checks to reach the instances in the instance group.</li><li>D. Create a tag on each instance with the name of the load balancer. Configure a firewall rule with the name of the load balancer as the source and the instance tag as the destination.</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C<br>
The best practice when configuration a health check is to check health and serve traffic on the same port. However, it is possible to perform health checks on one port, but serve traffic on another. If you do use two different ports, ensure that firewall rules and services running on instances are configured appropriately. If you run health checks and serve traffic on the same port, but decide to switch ports at some point, be sure to update both the backend service and the health check.<br>
Backend services that do not have a valid global forwarding rule referencing it will not be health checked and will have no health status.<br>

Provision users to Google&#x27;s directory<br>
The global Directory is available to both Cloud Platform and G Suite resources and can be provisioned by a number of means. Provisioned users can take advantage of rich authentication features including single sign-on (SSO), OAuth, and two-factor verification.<br>
You can provision users automatically using one of the following tools and services:<br>
Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS)</p><p>Google Admin SDK -</p><p>A third-party connector -<br>
GCDS is a connector that can provision users and groups on your behalf for both Cloud Platform and G Suite. Using GCDS, you can automate the addition, modification, and deletion of users, groups, and non-employee contacts. You can synchronize the data from your LDAP directory server to your Cloud Platform domain by using LDAP queries. This synchronization is one-way: the data in your LDAP directory server is never modified.<br>

On Linux instances, connect to your instance and manually resize your partitions and file systems to use the additional disk space that you added.<br>
Extend the file system on the disk or the partition to use the added space. If you grew a partition on your disk, specify the partition. If your disk does not have a partition table, specify only the disk ID. sudo resize2fs /dev/[DISK_ID][PARTITION_NUMBER] where [DISK_ID] is the device name and [PARTITION_NUMBER] is the partition number for the device where you are resizing the file system.<br>

You want to optimize this Dockerfile for faster deployment times without adversely affecting the app&#x27;s functionality.<br>
Which two actions should you take\? (Choose two.)</p><ul><li>A. Remove Python after running pip</li><li>B. Remove dependencies from requirements.txt</li><li>C. Use a slimmed-down base image like Alpine Linux</li><li>D. Use larger machine types for your Google Container Engine node pools</li><li>E. Copy the source after he package dependencies (Python and pip) are installed</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> CE<br>
The speed of deployment can be changed by limiting the size of the uploaded app, limiting the complexity of the build necessary in the Dockerfile, if present, and by ensuring a fast and reliable internet connection.<br>
Note: Alpine Linux is built around musl libc and busybox. This makes it smaller and more resource efficient than traditional GNU/Linux distributions. A container requires no more than 8 MB and a minimal installation to disk requires around 130 MB of storage. Not only do you get a fully-fledged Linux environment but a large selection of packages from the repository.<br>

The database is 4<br>
TB, and large updates are frequent. Replication requires private address space communication.<br>
Which networking approach should you use\?</p><ul><li>A. Google Cloud Dedicated Interconnect</li><li>B. Google Cloud VPN connected to the data center network</li><li>C. A NAT and TLS translation gateway installed on-premises</li><li>D. A Google Compute Engine instance with a VPN server installed connected to the data center network</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A<br>
Google Cloud Dedicated Interconnect provides direct physical connections and RFC 1918 communication between your on-premises network and Google&#x27;s network. Dedicated Interconnect enables you to transfer large amounts of data between networks, which can be more cost effective than purchasing additional bandwidth over the public Internet or using VPN tunnels.<br>
Benefits:  </p><ul><li>Traffic between your on-premises network and your VPC network doesn&#x27;t traverse the public Internet. Traffic traverses a dedicated connection with fewer hops, meaning there are less points of failure where traffic might get dropped or disrupted.  </li><li>Your VPC network&#x27;s internal (RFC 1918) IP addresses are directly accessible from your on-premises network. You don&#x27;t need to use a NAT device or VPN tunnel to reach internal IP addresses. Currently, you can only reach internal IP addresses over a dedicated connection. To reach Google external IP addresses, you must use a separate connection.  </li><li>You can scale your connection to Google based on your needs. Connection capacity is delivered over one or more 10 Gbps Ethernet connections, with a maximum of eight connections (80 Gbps total per interconnect).  </li><li>The cost of egress traffic from your VPC network to your on-premises network is reduced. A dedicated connection is generally the least expensive method if you have a high-volume of traffic to and from Google&#x27;s network.<br>Reference:<br><a href="https://cloud.google.com/interconnect/docs/details/dedicated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cloud.google.com/interconnect/docs/details/dedicated</a></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="question-41-topic-1"></a>Question #41 Topic 1<a class="hash-link" href="#question-41-topic-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Auditors visit your teams every 12 months and ask to review all the Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) policy changes in the previous 12 months.

A single Organization with Folders for each department</li><li>D. A single Organization with multiple projects, each with a central owner</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C<br>
Folders are nodes in the Cloud Platform Resource Hierarchy. A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of GCP resources. Folders allow you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies. While a folder can contain multiple folders or resources, a given folder or resource can have exactly one parent.<br>

Question The JencoMart security team requires that all Google Cloud Platform infrastructure is deployed using a least privilege model with separation of duties for administration between production and development resources.<br>
What Google domain and project structure should you recommend\?</p><ul><li>A. Create two G Suite accounts to manage users: one for development/test/staging and one for production. Each account should contain one project for every application</li><li>B. Create two G Suite accounts to manage users: one with a single project for all development applications and one with a single project for all production applications</li><li>C. Create a single G Suite account to manage users with each stage of each application in its own project</li><li>D. Create a single G Suite account to manage users with one project for the development/test/staging environment and one project for the production environment</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D<br>
Note: The principle of least privilege and separation of duties are concepts that, although semantically different, are intrinsically related from the standpoint of security. The intent behind both is to prevent people from having higher privilege levels than they actually need  </p><ul><li>Principle of Least Privilege: Users should only have the least amount of privileges required to perform their job and no more. This reduces authorization exploitation by limiting access to resources such as targets, jobs, or monitoring templates for which they are not authorized.  </li><li>Separation of Duties: Beyond limiting user privilege level, you also limit user duties, or the specific jobs they can perform. No user should be given responsibility for more than one related function. This limits the ability of a user to perform a malicious action and then cover up that action.<br>Reference:<br><a href="https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/separation-of-duties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/separation-of-duties</a></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="question-2-topic-2"></a>Question #2 Topic 2<a class="hash-link" href="#question-2-topic-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Introductory Info Company Overview -<br>

Question A few days after JencoMart migrates the user credentials database to Google Cloud Platform and shuts down the old server, the new database server stops responding to SSH connections. It is still serving database requests to the application servers correctly.<br>
What three steps should you take to diagnose the problem\? (Choose three.)</p><ul><li>A. Delete the virtual machine (VM) and disks and create a new one</li><li>B. Delete the instance, attach the disk to a new VM, and investigate</li><li>C. Take a snapshot of the disk and connect to a new machine to investigate</li><li>D. Check inbound firewall rules for the network the machine is connected to</li><li>E. Connect the machine to another network with very simple firewall rules and investigate</li><li>F. Print the Serial Console output for the instance for troubleshooting, activate the interactive console, and investigate</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> CDF<br>
D: Handling &quot;Unable to connect on port 22&quot; error message<br>
Possible causes include:  </p><ul><li>There is no firewall rule allowing SSH access on the port. SSH access on port 22 is enabled on all Compute Engine instances by default. If you have disabled access, SSH from the Browser will not work. If you run sshd on a port other than 22, you need to enable the access to that port with a custom firewall rule.  </li><li>The firewall rule allowing SSH access is enabled, but is not configured to allow connections from GCP Console services. Source IP addresses for browser- based SSH sessions are dynamically allocated by GCP Console and can vary from session to session.<br>F: Handling &quot;Could not connect, retrying...&quot; error<br>You can verify that the daemon is running by navigating to the serial console output page and looking for output lines prefixed with the accounts-from-metadata: string. If you are using a standard image but you do not see these output prefixes in the serial console output, the daemon might be stopped. Reboot the instance to restart the daemon.<br>Reference:<br><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ssh-in-browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ssh-in-browser</a><br><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ssh-in-browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ssh-in-browser</a></li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="question-3-topic-2"></a>Question #3 Topic 2<a class="hash-link" href="#question-3-topic-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Introductory Info Company Overview -<br>

Question JencoMart has decided to migrate user profile storage to Google Cloud Datastore and the application servers to Google Compute Engine (GCE). During the migration, the existing infrastructure will need access to Datastore to upload the data.<br>
What service account key-management strategy should you recommend\?</p><ul><li>A. Provision service account keys for the on-premises infrastructure and for the GCE virtual machines (VMs)</li><li>B. Authenticate the on-premises infrastructure with a user account and provision service account keys for the VMs</li><li>C.

Deploy a custom authentication service on GCE/Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for the on-premises infrastructure and use GCP managed keys for the VMs</li></ul><p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C<br>
Migrating data to Google Cloud Platform<br>
Let&#x27;s say that you have some data processing that happens on another cloud provider and you want to transfer the processed data to Google Cloud Platform. You can use a service account from the virtual machines on the external cloud to push the data to Google Cloud Platform. To do this, you must create and download a service account key when you create the service account and then use that key from the external process to call the Cloud Platform APIs.<br>

Our last game was the first time we used Google Cloud, and it was a tremendous success. We were able to analyze player behavior and game telemetry in ways that we never could before. This success allowed us to bet on a full migration to the cloud and to start building all-new games using cloud-native design principles.<br>
Our new game is our most ambitious to date and will open up doors for us to support more gaming platforms beyond mobile. Latency is our top priority, although cost management is the next most important challenge. As with our first cloud-based game, we have grown to expect the cloud to enable advanced analytics capabilities so we can rapidly iterate on our deployments of bug fixes and new functionality.
